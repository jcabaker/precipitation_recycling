Scripts to calculate precipitation recycling.

Scripts to calculate precipitation recycling following the methods of Brubaker et al. (1993) and Eltahir and Bras (1994). Scripts accompany the following paper:

Baker and Spracklen (2022) Divergent Representation of Precipitation Recycling in the Amazon and the Congo in CMIP6 Models. Geophysical Research Letters.

Scripts were developed by Jessica C. A. Baker at the University of Leeds (j.c.baker@leeds.ac.uk). If you are interested in using these scripts please send Jess a brief email and cite the reference above in your paper.
